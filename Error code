If an error occurs when processing a MultiChain API request, an error code is returned in a standard JSON-RPC error object. This object has two fields – code containing a numerical identifier for the error, and message containing a verbal description of its cause.

If you are using multichain-cli, both the error code and message will be displayed in the terminal window. If you are using the JSON-RPC API directly, your application should catch these errors and deal with them as appropriate.

In production releases of MultiChain, your application can assume that the code identifier for each type of error will not change. However the message strings are likely to change in future versions of MultiChain, and your application should not assume otherwise.

A full list of error codes and their meaning is provided below, alongside the name used for the error in MultiChain’s source code.

JSON-RPC processing errors
Code	Name	Description
-32600	RPC_INVALID_REQUEST	The JSON sent is not a valid JSON-RPC request object.
-32601	RPC_METHOD_NOT_FOUND	The method specified in the JSON-RPC request is not available in MultiChain.
-32602	RPC_INVALID_PARAMS	The parameters provided in the JSON-RPC request are not valid for the method that was called. In practice, this is not used – see instead RPC_INVALID_PARAMETER below.
-32603	RPC_INTERNAL_ERROR	An internal error occurred while processing the JSON-RPC request (you should report this to us).
-32700	RPC_PARSE_ERROR	The message sent cannot be parsed as a JSON-formatted string.
General application errors (from Bitcoin Core)

-717	RPC_GENERAL_FILE_ERROR	An error occurred when accessing the file path provided.
-718	RPC_UPGRADE_REQUIRED	This blockchain has been upgraded and requires a more recent version of MultiChain.
Peer-to-peer client errors
