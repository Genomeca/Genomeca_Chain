We envision a SAMChain to be shared amongst four types of nodes:

1) Owner nodes - a single individual who owns the data in question (e.g. patient).
2) Sequencing nodes - sequencing center(s) who will generate the digital data and push it to the chain.
3) Clinical nodes - physician(s) who will access, interpret, and analyze the data.
4) Research nodes - researcher(s) who will access, interpret, and analyze the data.

Below we detail the steps in Multichain to configure and work within this network ecosystem.

1) All participating nodes install Multichain, SAMChain, and dependencies (see README).

2) Owner node runs buildChain.py to create a SAMChain and data streams within the chain, which will store the sequencing data.

3) Sequencing node generates SAM/BAM file containing Owner's data, and requests access to the Owner's chain by running the following command:

    multichaind chainname@xxxxxxxxxxxxx -daemon -autosubscribe=streams
   
   ^In the above command, chainname@xxxxxxxxxxxxx is provided by the chain Owner. This command will output an alphanumeric string <yyyyyyy>.
   
4) The Chain owner grants the Sequencing node access by running the following command:

    multichain-cli chainname grant <yyyyyyy> connect,send,receive

    Upon granting this access, the Sequencing node will begin syncing the chain. 

5) The Sequencing node can now run insertData.py to insert data from an input SAM/BAM file to the Owner's chain. 

6) The Clinician and/or Research nodes, upon making contact with the Owner through other means, can follow steps (3) and (4) above to gain access to the chain. 

7) The Clinician and/or Research nodes can run queryReads.py, queryDepth.py, and pileup.py to interpret and analyze the Owner's data.
